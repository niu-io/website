  {
    question: "Can I keep my coding agent and its subscription?",
    answer:
      "That is a core integration goal: add visibility and model choices without replacing your coding agent or disrupting its existing coding-plan subscription. Compatibility must be verified per agent and plan. We do not yet claim support for every popular agent, and paid API fallback must be explicitly enabled; it is not included in your existing subscription.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where will ready-to-use models come from?",
    answer:
      "We plan to combine direct provider connections with OpenRouter as an optional fallback for broader model choice. Available models will depend on provider access and verified agent compatibility. This is planned coverage, not a promise that every model or subscription is supported today.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does model fusion mean?",
    answer:
      "Different parts of a complex task may suit different models: research, planning, writing, implementation or review. Our planned methodology uses execution evidence and controlled benchmarks to choose a model mix, then validates the complete task. Switching, repeated context, failed attempts and validation all count toward cost. A mix is useful when it meets the quality bar and offers a better fit for your budget and deadline. It need not be the cheapest or fastest option on its own.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can benchmarking reduce coding-agent costs?",
    answer:
      "Compare models using the same repository snapshot, agent setup and acceptance tests. Count every run, including failures, repairs and validation. A lower-cost model is useful only if it meets your quality and latency requirements. Benchmarking is a planned workflow; the interactive example above illustrates the decision, not measured savings.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to route model calls through Niu?",
    answer:
      "No. Importing execution metadata and investigating tasks are independent of inference forwarding. The integrated gateway is a separate entry point for applications that need model access.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use it just as an AI gateway?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Configure a provider and model alias, issue a scoped client key, and call the OpenAI-compatible chat API. Task imports, benchmarks and subscriptions are optional. Provider configuration currently lives on the server.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Niu collect prompts and source code?",
    answer:
      "The execution import contract is metadata-only by default. It excludes raw prompts, source, tool output and credentials. You choose what authorized metadata to import into your self-hosted installation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the first release production-ready?",
    answer:
      "Not yet. The public implementation is available for evaluation, and the first-release acceptance matrix tracks the remaining work. Native collectors, benchmark workflows, broader provider support and production qualification are still in progress.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is open source?",
    answer:
      "Niu-owned code is MIT licensed. Selected upstream modules retain their original licenses and attribution. The public core runs without a private service or enterprise license.",
